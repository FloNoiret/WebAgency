WebAgency is a project made for STUDI students enrolled in Graduate Developer Full Stack. 

The goal is to create a responsive website from a mockup with only HTML & CSS. 

In order to do so, I developed the basic HTML structure. Then, I styled it using SASS structure, but I used SCSS language to stay close to CSS writing standards. 

As I experimented different stylization, therefore, you can find some CSS flexbox, CSS grid, keyframes, etc...
