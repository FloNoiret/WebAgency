WebAgency is a project made for STUDI students enrolled in Graduate Developer Full Stack. 

The goal is to create a website from a mockup with only HTML & CSS. 

In order to do so, I develop the basic HTML structure. Then, I styled it using SASS structure but I used SCSS language to stay closed to CSS writting standards. 

As I experimented different stylizations, therefore, you can find some CSS flexbox, CSS grid, keyframes, etc...
